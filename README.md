In Week 10 of UTSA's Coding Bootcamp, we learned about Object-Oriented Programming and Test-Driven Development. At the completion of the Module, we were given a challege to create a Team Profile Generator. The generator had required criteria to meet, such as:

GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for my team members and their information
THEN an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input
WHEN I click on an email address in the HTML
THEN my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address
WHEN I click on the GitHub username
THEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab
WHEN I start the application
THEN I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
WHEN I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
THEN I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team
WHEN I select the engineer option
THEN I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu
WHEN I select the intern option
THEN I am prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu
WHEN I decide to finish building my team
THEN I exit the application, and the HTML is generated

I was able to get all the functionality to work properly and rather enjoyed all the logic that went into this project. My biggest obstacle was and still is the styling of the HTML output.

This project had no starter code, so all work was completed by me. All code was compelted in VS Studio Code, Added/Committed/Pushed up from GitBash and sent to a GitHub repository found here: https://github.com/amhernandez1163/team-profile-generator
